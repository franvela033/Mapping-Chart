            <p> Over 12 million people traveled during Thanksgiving Day in New York, according to data from the  Bureau of Transportation.</p>
            <p> The anonymously collected data is gathered through a sampling of mobile phone usage which contains no personal information. </p>
            <p> Of the data collected, however, statistics can show who is staying home, how far people are traveling and even where folks are traveling to.</p>
            <p> County data during Thanksgiving Day travel reveals nearly 1.5 million people in Kings County alone did not stay home. The reported data takes into account the time someone stays at a particular location other than their home. If the person spends 10 minutes or more at a single location, the data is logged into the database.</p>
            <p> Trips include transportation by means of driving, railways, transit and airlines.</p>

  <p>In an email response, Deputy Press Secretary Michael Lanza shared Health Commissioner Dr. Chokshi’s response to in-person gatherings and travel.</p>
  <p> “If you don’t absolutely have to, don’t travel. This will help protect not just your loved ones but also other New Yorkers,” he said. </p>

  <p> Dr. Nash, Professor of Epidemiology and Executive Director of CUNY's Institute for the Implementation of Science in Population Health, says that even if people are given ample notice and suggestions before traveling during the holiday season, "at the end of the day, people are going to do it anyway."</p>
  <p> He suggests that folks who do intend to travel during the holidays quarantine before. "I think politicans and health officials missed an important opportunity to enforce quarantining in advance, or even suggesting driving versus taking the train or flying," he said. </p>
  <p> Dr. Nash urged non-essential travel unless necessary. "Taking these preventative measures, could keep your loved ones, and yourself, around," he said. </p>
